Lorenz System of ordinar differential equations

The Lorenz system is a system of three ordinary differential equations notable for having chaotic solutions for certain
parameter values and initial conditions. In particular, the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz
system. The system has the form

dx/dt = s(y-x)
dy/dt = rx-y-xz
dz/dt = xy-bz

subject to appropriate initial conditions. As the parameters s, r, and b are varied through various ranges of values,
the solutions of this system of differential equations vary in form. In particular, for certain values of the parameters
the system exhibits chaotic behavior.
